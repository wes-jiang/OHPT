Let'ssayitmakesx1boxes ofPyramide perday,ataprot of $1each,andx2boxes ofNuit, atamore substantial prot of$6apiece;x1andx2areunknown values that wewish todetermine .Butthisisnotall;there arealsosome constraints onx1and x2that must beaccommodated (besides theobvious one,x1;x20).First, thedaily demand forthese exclusive chocolates islimited toatmost 200boxes ofPyramide and300boxes of Nuit. Also,thecurrent workforce canproduce atotal ofatmost400boxes ofchocolate perday. What aretheoptimal levels ofproduction? Werepresent thesituation byalinear program ,asfollows . Objective function maxx1+6x2 Constraints x1200 x2300 x1+x2400 x1;x20 Alinear equation inx1andx2denes aline inthetwo-dimensional (2D) plane ,and a linear inequality designates ahalf-space ,theregion ononeside oftheline.Thus theset ofallfeasible solutions ofthis linear program, that is,thepoints (x1;x2)whic hsatisfy all constraints ,istheintersection ofvehalf-spaces .Itisaconvex polygon, shown inFigure 7.1.

The optimum solution willbethevery lastfeasible point that theprot linesees andmust therefore beavertex of thepolygon, asshown inthegure .Iftheslope oftheprot linewere different, then itslast contact with thepolygon could beanentire edge rather than asingle vertex. Inthiscase,the optimum solution would notbeunique ,butthere would certainly beanoptimum vertex. Itisageneral rule oflinear programs that theoptimum isachieved atavertex ofthe feasible region. Theonly exceptions arecases inwhic hthere isnooptimum; thiscanhappen intwoways: 1.Thelinear program isinfeasible ;that is,theconstraints aresotight that itisimpossible tosatisfy allofthem. Forinstance , x1;x2: 2.The constraints aresoloose that thefeasible region isunbounded ,anditispossible to achieve arbitrarily high objective values .Forinstance , maxx1+x2 x1;x20 Solving linear programs Linear programs (LPs) canbesolved bythesimplex method ,devised byGeorge Dantzig in 1947. Weshall explain itinmore detail inSection 7.6,butbriey ,this algorithm starts ata vertex, inourcase perhaps (0;0),andrepeatedly looks foranadjacent vertex (connected by anedge ofthefeasible region) ofbetter objective value .Inthis wayitdoes hill-climbing on thevertices ofthepolygon, walking from neighbor toneighbor soastosteadily increase prot along theway.Here' sapossible trajectory . 100300 200 100 200 0Prot $1900 $0 $200$1400 Upon reaching avertex that hasnobetter neighbor ,simplex declares ittobeoptimal and halts .Why does this local test imply global optimality?

7⌘4⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 205 Thespace ofsolutions isnow three-dimensional. Eachlinear equation denes a3Dplane , andeachinequality ahalf-space ononesideoftheplane .Thefeasible region isanintersection ofseven half-spaces ,apolyhedron (Figure 7.2). Looking atthegure ,canyoudecipher whic h inequality corresponds toeachface ofthepolyhedron? Aprot ofccorresponds totheplanex1+6x2+13x3=c.Ascincreases ,thisprot-plane moves parallel toitself ,further andfurther intothepositive orthant until itnolonger touches thefeasible region. The point ofnal contact istheoptimal vertex: (0;300;100),with total prot $3100 . How would thesimplex algorithm beha veonthis modied problem? Asbefore ,itwould move from vertex tovertex, along edges ofthepolyhedron, increasing prot steadily .Apossi- bletrajectory isshown inFigure 7.2,corresponding tothefollowing sequence ofvertices and prots: (0;0;0) $0!(200;0;0) $200!(200;200;0) $1400!(200;0;200) $2800!(0;300;100) $3100 Finally ,upon reaching avertex with nobetter neighbor ,itwould stop anddeclare this tobe theoptimal point. Once again bybasic geometry ,ifallthevertex' sneighbors lieononeside oftheprot-plane ,then somust theentire polyhedron. Amagic trick called duality Here iswhy youshould believe that(0;300;100),with atotal prot of$3100 ,istheoptimum: Look backatthelinear program. Add thesecond inequality tothethird, andaddtothem thefourth multiplied by4.Theresult istheinequality x1+6x2+13x33100. Doyousee? This inequality saysthat nofeasible solution (valuesx1;x2;x3satisfying the constraints) canpossibly haveaprot greater than3100.Sowemust indeed havefound the optimum! Theonly question is,where didwegetthese mysterious multipliers (0;1;1;4)for thefour inequalities? InSection 7.4we'll seethat itisalwayspossible tocome upwith suchmultipliers by solving another LP!Except that (itgets even better) wedonoteven need tosolve thisother LP,because itisinfactsointimately connected totheoriginal oneit iscalled thedual  that solving theoriginal LPsolves thedual aswell! But wearegetting farahead ofour story . What ifweaddafourth lineofchocolates ,orhundreds more ofthem? Then theproblem becomes high-dimensional, andhard tovisualize .Simplex continues towork inthis general setting ,although wecannolonger rely upon simple geometric intuitions foritsdescription andjustication. Wewillstudy thefull-edged simplex algorithm inSection 7.6. Inthemeantime ,wecanrestassured intheknowledge that there aremany professional, industrial-strength packages that implement simplex and take care ofallthetrickydetails likenumeric precision. Inatypical application, themain task istherefore tocorrectly express theproblem asalinear program. Thepackage then takes care oftherest. Withthisinmind, let'slook atahigh-dimensional application.
7⌘5⌘206 Algorithms 7.1.2 Example: production planning This time,ourcompany makes handwoven carpets ,aproduct forwhic hthedemand isex- tremely seasonal. Our analyst hasjustobtained demand estimates forallmonths ofthenext calendar year:d1;d2;:::;d12.Asfeared, they arevery uneven, ranging from 440to920. Here' saquicksnapshot ofthecompany .Wecurrently have30employees ,eachofwhom makes 20carpets permonth andgets amonthly salary of$2;000.Wehavenoinitial surplus ofcarpets . How canwehandle theuctuations indemand? There arethree ways: 1.Overtime ,butthis isexpensive since overtime payis80% more than regular pay.Also, workers canputinatmost 30% overtime . 2.Hiring andring ,butthese cost$320 and$400, respectively ,perworker . 3.Storing surplus production ,butthis costs $8percarpet permonth. Wecurrently have nostored carpets onhand, andwemust endtheyear without anycarpets stored. This rather involved problem canbeformulated andsolved asalinear program! Acrucial rst step isdening thevariables . wi=number ofworkers duringithmonth;w0=30. xi=number ofcarpets made duringithmonth. oi=number ofcarpets made byovertime inmonthi. hi;fi=number ofworkers hired andred, respectively ,atbeginning ofmonthi. si=number ofcarpets stored atendofmonthi;s0=0. Allinall,there are72variables (74ifyoucountw0ands0). Wenow write theconstraints .First, allvariables must benonnegative: wi;xi;oi;hi;fi;si0;i=1;:::;12: Thetotal number ofcarpets made permonth consists ofregular production plus overtime: xi=20wi+oi (one constraint foreachi=1;:::;12).The number ofworkers canpotentially change atthe start ofeachmonth: wi=wi1+hifi: The number ofcarpets stored attheendofeachmonth iswhat westarted with, plus the number wemade ,minus thedemand forthemonth: si=si1+xidi: And overtime islimited: oi6wi:
7⌘6⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 207 Finally ,what istheobjective function? Itistominimize thetotal cost: min2000X iwi+320X ihi+400X ifi+8X isi+180X ioi; alinear function ofthevariables .Solving this linear program bysimplex should take less than asecond andwillgive ustheoptimum business strategy forourcompany . Well,almost. Theoptimum solution might turn outtobefractional ;forinstance ,itmight involve hiring 10:6workers inthemonth ofMarc h.This number would havetoberounded to either 10or11inorder tomake sense ,andtheoverall cost would then increase correspond- ingly .Inthepresent example ,most ofthevariables take onfairly large (double-digit) values , and thus rounding isunlikely toaffect things toomuch.There areother LPs,however ,in whic hrounding decisions havetobemade very carefully inorder toendupwith aninteger solution ofreasonable quality . Ingeneral, there isatension inlinear programming between theease ofobtaining frac- tional solutions and thedesirability ofinteger ones.Asweshall seeinChapter 8,nding theoptimum integer solution ofanLPisanimportant butvery hard problem, called integer linear programming . 7.1.3 Example: optimum bandwidth allocation Next weturn toaminiaturized version ofthekind ofproblem anetwork service provider might face. Suppose wearemanaging anetwork whose lines havethebandwidths shown inFig- ure7.3, and weneed toestablish three connections: between usersAandB,betweenB andC,andbetweenAandC.Eachconnection requires atleast twounits ofbandwidth, but canbeassigned more .Connection ABpays$3perunit ofbandwidth, andconnections BC andACpay$2and$4,respectively . Eachconnection canberouted intwoways,along path andashort path, orbyacombina- tion: forinstance ,twounits ofbandwidth viatheshort route ,oneviathelong route .How do weroute these connections tomaximize ournetwork' srevenue? This isalinear program. Wehavevariables foreachconnection and eachpath (long or short); forexample ,xABistheshort-path bandwidth allocated totheconnection betweenA andB,andx0 ABthelong-path bandwidth forthissame connection. Wedemand that noedge' s bandwidth isexceeded andthat eachconnection gets abandwidth ofatleast 2units .

Looking backattheoriginal network, weseethat every edge exceptac isused atfullcapacity . One cautionary observation: ourLPhasonevariable forevery possible path between the users .Inalarger network, there could easily beexponentially many suchpaths ,andtherefore
7⌘8⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 209 thisparticular wayoftranslating thenetwork problem intoanLPwillnotscale well. Wewill seeacleverer andmore scalable formulation inSection 7.2. Here' saparting question foryoutoconsider .Suppose weremoved theconstraint that eachconnection should receive atleast twounits ofbandwidth. Would theoptimum change? Reductions Sometimes acomputational task issufciently general that anysubroutine foritcanalso beused tosolve avariety ofother tasks ,whic hatrst glance might seem unrelated. For instance ,wesawinChapter 6how analgorithm fornding thelongest path inadagcan, surprisingly ,also beused fornding longest increasing subsequences .Wedescribe thisphe- nomenon bysaying that thelongest increasing subsequence problem reduces tothelongest path problem inadag.Inturn, thelongest path inadagreduces totheshortest path ina dag; here' show asubroutine forthelatter canbeused tosolve theformer: function LONGESTPATH(G) negate alledge weights ofG return SHORTESTPATH(G) Let'sstep backandtake aslightly more formal view ofreductions .Ifanysubroutine for taskQcanalso beused tosolveP,wesayPreduces toQ.Often,Pissolvable byasingle calltoQ'ssubroutine ,whic hmeans anyinstancexofPcanbetransformed intoaninstance yofQsuchthatP(x)canbededuced fromQ(y): Postprocess x P(x)Q(y)Algorithm forP PreprocessforQAlgorithmy (Doyouseethat thereduction fromP=LONGESTPATHtoQ=SHORTESTPATHfollows thisschema?) Ifthepre- andpostprocessing procedures areefciently computable then this creates anefcient algorithm forPoutofanyefcient algorithm forQ! Reductions enhance thepower ofalgorithms: Once wehaveanalgorithm forproblem Q(whic hcould beshortest path, forexample) wecanuseittosolve other problems .In fact, most ofthecomputational tasks westudy inthis book areconsidered core computer science problems precisely because they arise insomany different applications ,whic his another wayofsaying that many problems reduce tothem. This isespecially true oflinear programming .
7⌘9⌘210 Algorithms 7.1.4 Variants oflinear programming Asevidenced inourexamples ,ageneral linear program hasmany degrees offreedom. 1.Itcanbeeither amaximization oraminimization problem. 2.Itsconstraints canbeequations and/or inequalities . 3.The variables areoften restricted tobenonnegative ,butthey canalso beunrestricted insign. Wewillnow show that these various LPoptions canallbereduced tooneanother viasimple transformations .Here' show. 1.Toturn amaximization problem into aminimization (orvice versa), just multiply the coefcients oftheobjective function by1. 2a.Toturn aninequality constraint likePn i=1aixibinto anequation, introduce anew variablesanduse nX i=1aixi+s=b s0: Thissiscalled theslackvariable fortheinequality .Asjustication, observe that a vector (x1;:::;xn)satises theoriginal inequality constraint ifandonly ifthere issome s0forwhic hitsatises thenew equality constraint. 2b.Tochange anequality constraint into inequalities iseasy: rewriteax=bastheequiva- lent pair ofconstraints axbandaxb. 3.Finally ,todeal with avariablexthat isunrestricted insign, dothefollowing: Introduce twononnegative variables ,x+;x0. Replacex,wherever itoccurs intheconstraints ortheobjective function, byx+x. This way,xcantake onany real value byappropriately adjusting thenew variables . More precisely ,anyfeasible solution totheoriginal LPinvolvingxcanbemapped toa feasible solution ofthenew LPinvolvingx+;x,andviceversa. Byapplying these transformations wecanreduce anyLP(maximization orminimization, with both inequalities andequations ,andwith both nonnegative andunrestricted variables) into anLPofamuchmore constrained kind that wecallthestandard form,inwhic hthe variables areallnonnegative ,theconstraints areallequations ,andtheobjective function is tobeminimized. Forexample ,ourrst linear program gets rewritten thus:

Any LPcanlikewise berecast inthisway,using thereductions given earlier . Matrix-vector notation Alinear function likex1+6x2canbewritten asthedotproduct oftwovectors c=1 6 andx=x1 x2 ; denoted cxorcTx.Similarly ,linear constraints canbecompiled into matrix-vector form: x1200 x2300 x1+x2400=)0 @10 01 111 A |{z}x1 x2 0 @200 300 4001 A |{z}: A x b Here eachrowofmatrix Acorresponds tooneconstraint: itsdotproduct withxisatmost thevalue inthecorresponding row ofb.Inother words ,iftherows ofAarethevectors a1;:::;am,then thestatement Axbisequivalent to aixbiforalli=1;:::;m.

Once wehavestudied itin more detail (Section 7.6), wewillbeinaposition tounderstand exactly how ithandles ow LPs,whic hisuseful asasource ofinspiration fordesigning direct max-ow algorithms . Itturns outthat infactthebeha viorofsimplex hasanelementary interpretation: Start with zero ow. Repeat: choose anappropriate path fromstot,andincrease ow along theedges ofthispath asmuchaspossible . Figure 7.5(a)(d) shows asmall example inwhic hsimplex halts after twoiterations .The nal ow hassize2,whic hiseasily seen tobeoptimal.
7⌘13⌘214 Algorithms There isjustonecomplication. What ifwehadinitially chosen adifferent path, theonein Figure 7.5(e)? This gives only oneunit ofow andyetseems toblockallother paths .Simplex gets around this problem byalso allowing paths tocancel existing ow.Inthis particular case,itwould subsequently choose thepath ofFigure 7.5(f). Edge (b;a)ofthis path isn't in theoriginal network andhastheeffect ofcanceling ow previously assigned toedge(a;b). Tosummarize ,ineachiteration simplex looks foranstpath whose edges (u;v)canbe oftwotypes: 1.(u;v)isintheoriginal network, andisnotyetatfullcapacity . 2.Thereverse edge(v;u)isintheoriginal network, andthere issome ow along it. Ifthecurrent ow isf,then intherst case,edge(u;v)canhandle uptocuvfuvadditional units ofow,and inthesecond case,uptofvuadditional units (canceling allorpart ofthe existing ow on(v;u)).These ow-increasing opportunities canbecaptured inaresidual networ kGf=(V;Ef),whic hhasexactly thetwotypes ofedges listed, with residual capacities cf: cuvfuvif(u;v)2Eandfuv<cuv fvu if(v;u)2Eandfvu>0 Thus wecanequivalently think ofsimplex aschoosing anstpath intheresidual network. Bysimulating thebeha vior ofsimplex, wegetadirect algorithm forsolving max-ow .It proceeds initerations ,eachtime explicitly constructing Gf,nding asuitablestpath in Gfbyusing ,say,alinear -time breadth-rst searc h,andhalting ifthere isnolonger anysuch path along whic how canbeincreased. Figure 7.6illustrates thealgorithm onouroilexample . 7.2.4 Acerticate ofoptimality Now foratruly remarkable fact: notonly does simplex correctly compute amaximum ow, butitalso generates ashort proof oftheoptimality ofthisow! Let'sseeanexample ofwhat thismeans .Partition thenodes oftheoilnetwork (Figure 7.4) into twogroups ,L=fs;a;bgandR=fc;d;e;tg: sa b cd et33 410 12 1 512 5L R Any oiltransmitted must pass fromLtoR.Therefore ,noow canpossibly exceed thetotal capacity oftheedges fromLtoR,whic his7.Butthis means that theow wefound earlier , ofsize7,must beoptimal!
7⌘14⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 215 More generally ,an(s;t)-cutpartitions thevertices into twodisjoint groupsLandRsuch thatsisinLandtisinR.Itscapacity isthetotal capacity oftheedges fromLtoR,andas argued previously ,isanupper bound onanyow: Pickanyowfandany(s;t)-cut(L;R).Then size(f)capacity (L;R). Some cuts arelarge and give loose upper boundscut (fs;b;cg;fa;d;e;tg)hasacapacity of 19.Butthere isalso acutofcapacity 7,whic hiseffectively acerticate ofoptimality ofthe maximum ow.This isn't justaluckyproperty ofouroilnetwork; suchacutalways exists . Max-ow min-cut theorem Thesizeofthemaximum ow inanetwork equals thecapacity ofthesmallest (s;t)-cut. Moreover ,ouralgorithm automatically nds thiscutasaby-product! Let'sseewhy thisistrue.Supposefisthenal ow when thealgorithm terminates .We know that nodetisnolonger reachable fromsintheresidual networkGf.LetLbethenodes that arereachable fromsinGf,andletR=VLbetherest ofthenodes .Then (L;R)isa cutinthegraphG: L R ts e0e Weclaim that size(f)=capacity (L;R): Toseethis,observe that bythewayLisdened, anyedge going fromLtoRmust beatfull capacity (inthecurrent owf),and anyedge fromRtoLmust havezero ow.(So,inthe gure ,fe=ceandfe0=0.)Therefore thenetow across (L;R)isexactly thecapacity ofthe cut. 7.2.5 Efciency Eachiteration ofourmaximum-ow algorithm isefcient, requiringO(jEj)time ifadepth- rst orbreadth-rst searc hisused tondanstpath. Buthow many iterations arethere? Suppose alledges intheoriginal network haveinteger capacitiesC.Then aninductive argument shows that oneachiteration ofthealgorithm, theow isalwaysaninteger and increases byaninteger amount. Therefore ,since themaximum ow isatmostCjEj(why?), itfollows that thenumber ofiterations isatmost thismuch.Butthisishardly areassuring bound: what ifCisinthemillions? Weexamine this issue further inExercise 7.31. Itturns outthat itisindeed possible to construct badexamples inwhic hthenumber ofiterations isproportional toC,ifstpaths arenotcarefully chosen. However ,ifpaths arechosen inasensible manner in particular ,by
7⌘15⌘216 Algorithms using abreadth-rst searc h,whic hnds thepath with thefewest edgesthen thenumber of iterations isatmostO(jVjjEj),nomatter what thecapacities are.This latter bound gives anoverall running time ofO(jVjjEj2)formaximum ow.

Unfortunately ,thisisthe exception rather than therule: aswewillseeinChapter 8,itisavery difcult problem to ndtheoptimum solution (orforthat matter ,anysolution) ofageneral linear program, ifwe also demand that thevariables beintegers . 7.4 Duality Wehaveseen that innetworks ,ows aresmaller than cuts,butthemaximum ow andmini- mum cutexactly coincide andeachistherefore acerticate oftheother' soptimality .Remark- able asthisphenomenon is,wenow generalize itfrom maximum ow toanyproblem that can besolved bylinear programming! Itturns outthat every linear maximization problem hasa dual minimization problem, andthey relate toeachother inmuchthesame wayasows and cuts. Tounderstand what duality isabout, recall ourintroductory LPwith thetwotypes of chocolate: maxx1+6x2 x1200 x2300 x1+x2400 x1;x20 Simplex declares theoptimum solution tobe(x1;x2)=(100;300),with objective value 1900. Can thisanswer becheckedsomehow? Let'ssee:suppose wetake therst inequality andadd ittosixtimes thesecond inequality .Weget x1+6x22000: This isinteresting ,because ittells usthat itisimpossible toachieve aprot ofmore than 2000.Can weaddtogether some other combination oftheLPconstraints andbring thisupper bound even closer to1900?After alittle experimentation, wend that multiplying thethree inequalities by0,5,and1,respectively ,andadding them upyields x1+6x21900: So1900 must indeed bethebest possible value! Themultipliers (0;5;1)magically constitute a certicate ofoptimality !Itisremarkable that suchacerticate exists forthis LPand even ifweknew there were one,how would wesystematically goabout nding it?
7⌘20⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 221 Let'sinvestigate theissue bydescribing what weexpect ofthese three multipliers ,call themy1;y2;y3.

What wewantisabound that isastight aspossible ,soweshould minimize 200y1+300y2+400y3subject tothepreceding inequalities .And thisisanew linear program !

Here isjustsuchapair: Primal :(x1;x2)=(100;300); Dual :(y1;y2;y3)=(0;5;1): They both havevalue 1900,andtherefore they certify eachother' soptimality (Figure 7.9).

ItisRow' s gain andColumn' sloss. G=Column rps r011 p101Rows110 Now suppose thetwoofthem playthis game repeatedly .IfRow alwaysmakes thesame move ,Column will quicklycatchonand will alwaysplaythecountermove ,winning every time.Therefore Row should mix things up:wecanmodel this byallowing Row tohavea mixed strategy ,inwhic honeachturn sheplaysrwith probability x1,pwith probability x2, andswith probability x3.This strategy isspecied bythevector x=(x1;x2;x3),positive numbers that addupto1.Similarly ,Column' smixed strategy issomey=(y1;y2;y3).2 Onanygiven round ofthegame ,there isanxiyjchance that Row andColumn willplay theithandjthmoves ,respectively .Therefore theexpected (average) payoffis X i;jGijProb[Row playsi,Column playsj]=X i;jGijxiyj: Row wants tomaximize this,while Column wants tominimize it.What payoffs canthey hope toachieve inrock-paper -scissors? Well,suppose forinstance that Row playsthecompletely random strategy x=(1=3;1=3;1=3).IfColumn playsr,then theaverage payoff(reading the rst column ofthegame matrix) willbe 1 30+1 31+1 31=0: This isalso true ifColumn playsp,ors.And since thepayoffofanymixed strategy (y1;y2;y3) isjustaweighted average oftheindividual payoffs forplayingr,p,ands,itmust also bezero. This canbeseen directly from thepreceding formula, X i;jGijxiyj=X i;jGij1 3yj=X jyj X i1 3Gij! =X jyj0=0; where thesecond-to-last equality istheobservation that every column ofGadds uptozero. Thus byplaying thecompletely random strategy ,Row forces anexpected payoffofzero,no matter what Column does.This means that Column cannot hope foranegative (expected) 2Also ofinterest arescenarios inwhic hplayers alter their strategies from round toround, butthese canget very complicated andareavast subject unto themselves .

But symmetrically , ifColumn playsthecompletely random strategy ,healso forces anexpected payoff ofzero, andthus Row cannot hope forapositive (expected) payoff.Inshort, thebest eachplayercan doistoplaycompletely randomly ,with anexpected payoffofzero.Wehavemathematically conrmed what youknew allalong about rock-paper -scissors! Let'sthink about thisinaslightly different way,byconsidering twoscenarios: 1.FirstRow announces herstrategy ,andthen Column pickshis. 2.FirstColumn announces hisstrategy ,andthen Row chooses hers. We've seen that theaverage payoffisthesame (zero) ineither case ifboth parties playop- timally .Butthis might well beduetothehigh level ofsymmetry inrock-paper -scissors .In general games ,we'dexpect therst option tofavorColumn, since heknows Row' sstrategy and canfully exploit itwhile choosing hisown. Likewise ,we'dexpect thesecond option to favorRow.Amazingly ,thisisnotthecase: ifboth playoptimally ,then itdoesn't hurt aplayer toannounce hisorherstrategy inadvance! What' smore ,this remarkable property isacon- sequence ofand infactequivalent tolinear programming duality . Let'sinvestigate thiswith anonsymmetric game .Imagine apresidential election scenario inwhic hthere aretwocandidates forofce ,andthemoves they make correspond tocampaign issues onwhic hthey canfocus (the initials stand foreconomy ,society ,morality ,andtaxcut). Thepayoffentries aremillions ofvotes lostbyColumn. G=mt e31 s21 Suppose Row announces that shewillplaythemixed strategy x=(1=2;1=2).What should Column do?Movemwillincur anexpected lossof1=2,whiletwillincur anexpected lossof0. Thebest response ofColumn istherefore thepure strategy y=(0;1). More generally ,once Row' sstrategy x=(x1;x2)isxed, there isalwaysapure strategy that isoptimal forColumn: either movem,with payoff3x12x2,ort,with payoffx1+x2, whic hever issmaller .After all,anymixed strategy yisaweighted average ofthese twopure strategies andthus cannot beat thebetter ofthetwo. Therefore ,ifRow isforced toannounce xbefore Column plays,sheknows that hisbest response will achieve anexpected payoffofminf3x12x2;x1+x2g.She should choose x defensivel ytomaximize herpayoffagainst thisbest response: Pick(x1;x2)that maximizes minf3x12x2;x1+x2g|{z} payofffrom Column' sbest response tox This choice ofxi'sgives Row thebest possible guarantee about herexpected payoff.And we willnow seethat itcanbefound byanLP!Themain trickistonotice that forxedx1andx2 thefollowing areequivalent:

Hence ,they havethesame optimum, callitV. Letussummarize .Bysolving anLP,Row (the maximizer) candetermine astrategy for herself that guarantees anexpected outcome ofatleastVnomatter what Column does.And bysolving thedual LP,Column (theminimizer) canguarantee anexpected outcome ofatmost V,nomatter what Row does.Itfollows that thisistheuniquely dened optimal play:apriori itwasn't even certain that suchaplayexisted.Visknown asthevalue ofthegame .Inour example ,itis1=7andisrealized when Row playsheroptimum mixed strategy (3=7;4=7)and Column playshisoptimum mixed strategy (2=7;5=7). This example iseasily generalized toarbitrary games and shows theexistence ofmixed strategies that areoptimal forboth players andachieve thesame valuea fundamental result ofgame theory called themin-max theorem .Itcanbewritten inequation form asfollows: max xmin yX i;jGijxiyj=min ymax xX i;jGijxiyj: This issurprising ,because theleft-hand side,inwhic hRow hastoannounce herstrategy rst, should presumably bebetter forColumn than theright-hand side,inwhic hhehastogo rst. Duality equalizes thetwo,asitdidwith maximum ows andminimum cuts.

Insome cases anLPisunbounded, inthat itsobjective function canbe made arbitrarily large (orsmall, ifit'saminimization problem). Ifthis isthecase,simplex will discover it:inexploring theneighborhood ofavertex, itwill notice that taking outan inequality andadding another leads toanunderdetermined system ofequations that hasan innity ofsolutions .And infact(this isaneasy test) thespace ofsolutions contains awhole lineacross whic htheobjective canbecome larger andlarger ,allthewayto1.Inthis case simplex halts andcomplains . 7.6.4 The running time ofsimplex What istherunning time ofsimplex, forageneric linear program maxcTxsuchthatAx0andx0; where there arenvariables andAcontainsminequality constraints? Since itisaniterative algorithm that proceeds from vertex tovertex, let'sstart bycomputing thetime taken fora single iteration. Suppose thecurrent vertex isu.Bydenition, itistheunique point atwhic h ninequality constraints aresatised with equality .Eachofitsneighbors sharesn1ofthese inequalities ,soucanhaveatmostnmneighbors: choose whic hinequality todrop andwhic h new onetoadd. Anaive waytoperform aniteration would betocheckeachpotential neighbor tosee whether itreally isavertex ofthepolyhedron andtodetermine itscost. Finding thecost is quick,justadotproduct, butchecking whether itisatrue vertex involves solving asystem of nequations innunknowns (that is,satisfying thenchosen inequalities exactly) andchecking whether theresult isfeasible .ByGaussian elimination (see thefollowing box) this takes O(n3)time,giving anunappetizing running time ofO(mn4)periteration. Fortunately ,there isamuchbetter way,andthismn4factor canbeimproved tomn,mak- ingsimplex apractical algorithm. Recall ourearlier discussion (Section 7.6.2) about thelocal view from vertex u.Itturns outthat theper-iteration overhead ofrewriting theLPinterms ofthecurrent local coordinates isjustO((m+n)n);this exploits thefactthat thelocal view changes only slightly between iterations ,injustoneofitsdening inequalities . Next, toselect thebest neighbor ,werecall that the(local view of)theobjective function is oftheform maxcu+~cywherecuisthevalue oftheobjective function atu.This immediately identies apromising direction tomove: wepickany~ci>0(ifthere isnone ,then thecurrent vertex isoptimal andsimplex halts). Since therestoftheLPhasnow been rewritten interms ofthey-coordinates ,itiseasy todetermine how muchyicanbeincreased before some other inequality isviolated. (And ifwecanincreaseyiindenitely ,weknow theLPisunbounded.) Itfollows that therunning time periteration ofsimplex isjustO(mn).But how many iterations could there be?Naturally ,there can't bemore thanm+n n ,whic hisanupper bound onthenumber ofvertices .Butthis upper bound isexponential inn.And infact, there are examples ofLPs forwhic hsimplex does indeed take anexponential number ofiterations .In

7⌘34⌘S.Dasgupta, C.H.Papadimitriou, andU.V.Vazirani 235 Gaussian elimination Under ouralgebraic denition, merely writing down thecoordinates ofavertex involves solving asystem oflinear equations .How isthisdone? Wearegiven asystem ofnlinear equations innunknowns ,sayn=4and x12x3 =2 x2+x3 =3 x1+x2x4=4 x2+3x3+x4=5 The high school method forsolving suchsystems istorepeatedly apply thefollowing rule: ifweadd amultiple ofoneequation toanother equation, theoverall system ofequations remains equivalent. Forexample ,adding1times therst equation tothethird one,weget theequivalent system x12x3 =2 x2+x3 =3 x2+2x3x4=2 x2+3x3+x4=5 This transformation isclever inthefollowing sense: iteliminates thevariablex1from the third equation, leaving justoneequation withx1.Inother words ,ignoring therst equation, wehaveasystem ofthree equations inthree unknowns: wedecreasednby1!Wecansolve thissmaller system togetx2;x3;x4,andthen plug these into therst equation togetx1. This suggests analgorithmonce more duetoGauss . procedure gauss(E;X) Input: AsystemE=fe1;:::;engofequations innunknowns X=fx1;:::;xng: e1:a11x1+a12x2++a1nxn=b1;;en:an1x1+an2x2++annxn=bn Output: Asolution ofthesystem, ifoneexists ifallcoefficients ai1arezero: haltwithmessage ``either infeasible ornotlinearly independent'' ifn=1:returnb1=a11 choosethecoefficient ap1oflargest magnitude, andswapequations e1;ep fori=2ton: ei=ei(ai1=a11)e1 (x2;:::;xn)=gauss (Efe1g;Xfx1g) x1=(b1P j>1a1jxj)=a11 return (x1;:::;xn) (When choosing theequation toswapinto rst place ,wepicktheonewith largestjap1jfor reasons ofnumerical accuracy ;after all,wewillbedividing byap1.) Gaussian elimination usesO(n2)arithmetic operations toreduce theproblem size from nton1,andthus usesO(n3)operations overall. Toshow that thisisalso agood estimate ofthetotal running time,weneed toargue that thenumbers involved remain polynomi- ally boundedfor instance ,that thesolution (x1;:::;xn)does notrequire toomuchmore precision towrite down than theoriginal coefcients aijandbi.Doyouseewhy thisistrue?
7⌘35⌘236 Algorithms Linear programming inpolynomial time Simplex isnotapolynomial time algorithm. Certain rare kinds oflinear programs cause ittogofrom onecorner ofthefeasible region toabetter corner and then toastill better one,andsoonforanexponential number ofsteps .Foralong time,linear programming was considered aparadox, aproblem that canbesolved inpractice ,butnotintheory! Then, in1979, ayoung Soviet mathematician called Leonid Khac hiyan came upwith theellipsoid algorithm ,onethat isvery different from simplex, extremely simple inits conception (but sophisticated initsproof) and yetonethat solves any linear program in polynomial time.Instead ofchasing thesolution from onecorner ofthepolyhedron to thenext, Khac hiyan' salgorithm connes ittosmaller andsmaller ellipsoids (skewed high- dimensional balls). When thisalgorithm wasannounced, itbecame akind ofmathematical Sputnik, asplashy achievement that hadtheU.S.establishment worried, intheheight of theCold War,about thepossible scientic superiority oftheSoviet Union. The ellipsoid algorithm turned outtobeanimportant theoretical advance ,butdidnotcompete well with simplex inpractice .The paradox oflinear programming deepened: Aproblem with two algorithms ,onethat isefcient intheory ,andonethat isefcient inpractice! Afewyears later Narendra Karmarkar ,agraduate student atUCBerkeley ,came up with acompletely different idea, whic hledtoanother provably polynomial algorithm for linear programming .Karmarkar' salgorithm isknown astheinterior point method ,because itdoes just that: itdashes totheoptimum corner notbyhopping from corner tocorner on thesurface ofthepolyhedron likesimplex does,butbycutting aclever path intheinterior ofthepolyhedron. And itdoes perform well inpractice . But perhaps the greatest advance inlinear programming algorithms wasnot Khac hiyan' stheoretical breakthrough orKarmarkar' snovel approac h,butanunexpected consequence ofthelatter: theerce competition between thetwoapproac hes,simplex and interior point, resulted inthedevelopment ofvery fastcode forlinear programming . 7.7 Postscript: circuit evaluation The importance oflinear programming stems from theastounding variety ofproblems that reduce toitandthereby bear witness toitsexpressive power .Inasense ,thisnext oneisthe ultimate application.
