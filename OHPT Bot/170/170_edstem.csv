1075,"Grading Update. Hi all, We've noticed some inaccuracies in some of the questions and solutions for the final exam so we'll be making the following adjustments. q7.4.e: This question is too vague since it's possible for C and E to be in the same SCC and it's possible that they aren't. We did not specify they must necessarily be in different SCCs. Thus, we gave everyone credit for this question. q9.4: The answer could be False or True if P=NP depending on whether you assume the problems are decision problems or optimization problems. Therefore we gave both solutions full credit. q9.5: The answer could be `False` or `True if P=NP` depending on whether you assume the problems are decision problems or optimization problems. Therefore we gave both solutions full credit. We've updated the solutions to reflect this. There's no additional action you need to take at this time. We will be processing regrade requests shortly."

TLDR: Final Exam, HW12, HW13 Grades Published, submit regrade requests by Tuesday 5/16 at 11:59pm. Due to grading deadline, we cannot honor any late regrade requests for any reason.

Regrades: Regrades requests are open and they are due Tuesday 5/16 at 11:59pm. Due to grading deadline, we cannot honor any late regrade requests for any reason. You should submit a regrade request only after you have read the solutions, the common mistakes document, and the rubric, and determined that we misgraded your solution with respect to the rubric. We will not accept regrades that contest the rubric or argue for more points without citing the rubric. Post any alternate solutions below along with a proof of correctness. Regrades must follow the following format or they will not be considered: """"I think I should get <+ x points> for rubric item <quote rubric item text>. <quote lines from your solution which are relevant>. <explain any misinterpretation if needed>."""" (please don't include any other information) Please do not post on Edstem to ask if you should submit a regrade request unless you have an alternate solution that the rubric doesn't consider. Make the request if you think you should've got more points and we'll take a look at it. Followups that ask questions that this post already answers, excessive +1's or ask questions that should be directed to regrades (i.e. questions containing """"should I make a regrade request about ..."""") will be deleted to reduce clutter so that staff can find questions that require responses with more ease (a common response on the mid-semester survey is that there are too many followups that can be avoided by reading posts more carefully). That being said, feel free to ask questions or make jokes. FAQ (will keep updating this section): - Make a private post if you have an issue with your exam (eg, missing exam). Do not make a followup about this. - Details about the curve/passing cutoffs will not be finalized until after the final exam. Using individual assignment distributions along with Berkeleytime distributions can help you estimate your grade. Good job everyone - Please don't be demotivated by low raw scores as the class is curved. """
1026,"[grades NOT published yet] Regrade Logistics + MT2 Q10 update. Hi all, Congratulations on finishing your finals! Our current goal is to release HW 12, HW 13, and Final grades Monday morning. Due to the grade deadline, we will have a shorter than normal regrade window. The regrade window for HW 12, HW 13, and Final will be around 24 hours, likely due Tuesday night. We apologize in advance for the short window; however, we hope this will allow us to post final grades as soon as possible. Also, we have an update on Midterm 2 grading. For Q10 (Chess dominos), we realized that simply storing the number of columns as a parameter for the subproblem is sufficient for solving the problem. Hence, we have given full credit (for part (i)) to those who defined their subproblem based on columns (but not rows). If you have any further questions regarding your solution for MT Q10, please make a private post as soon as possible!"

2,"Welcome to CS170! We would like to welcome you to Spring 2023 iteration of CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, taught by Professor Prasad Raghavendra and Professor John Wright. Syllabus Please read the course syllabus (website still WIP, refer to this post for any reference to dates, times and links) which has the majority of the course logistics. Lectures As indicated in this semester's course catalogue, the lecture will be held in Lewis 100 every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11:00am to 11:59am. Lectures will be asynchronously recorded. Examinations As of now, exams are scheduled as follows: Midterm 1: Monday, 2023 February 27, 19:00 - 21:00 (7pm-9pm) Midterm 2: Wednesday, 2023 April 5, 19:00 - 21:00 (7pm-9pm) Final: Tuesday, 2023 May 09, 19:00 - 22:00 (7pm-10pm) (Group 8) We are not planning on offering examinations at an alternate time under any circumstance. If you have a conflict, ""ask the other class for an alternate exam, or if they say no, choose which of the two classes to take this term and drop the other."" We are not planning on offering examinations remotely. Exam-specific policy will be released closer to the exam dates. Cancellation of Project, and Grading Policy This semester, we have decided to remove the CS170 project that has decade-long history. Historically, project consists 5% of students' total grade. We are also discussing the possibility of adjusting the weight of homework. We will communicate with you about the grading breakdown policy as soon as we explored the full complexity of such an adjustment and made considerate decisions. Prerequisites As outlined in the course catalogue, we will not enforce course prerequisites for this semester. Should you find certain materials challenging potentially because of missed prerequisites, please consult resources from that class. Communication and Gradescope We will use Edstem (this platform) for questions and online discussion and Gradescope for assignment submission and examination release. You will see a bCourses site on your bCourses dashboard but it will not be used as a form of communication – instead, you can gain access to Edstem and bCourses by going to the bCourses site and clicking ""Ed Discussion"" or ""Gradescope"" on the left. However, if you are enrolled in CalCentral but not bCourses site (which you shouldn't), please contact staff. bCourses/Kaltura also may or may not be used to publish course recordings as in the past there were occasions that for course recordings to become available for upload on YouTube, they must be closed-captioned first for compliance (see NAD v. Harvard) and such process take time. Please contact staff if you are auditing or are attending this course but not enrolled through CalCentral (e.g. non-BISP exchange students). Emails If you find yourself uncomfortable making a private Ed post addressing your issue, for logistics and administrative questions only, you may also email cs170@, a private email that is only seen by the Head TAs and Professors. Homework 1 Homework 1 (our first homework, which is not HW0) will be released on next Tuesday on Jan 24, and will be due on the next Monday after it was released (Jan 30). Discussion and Office Hours No Discussion or Office Hour will take place this week (1/16-1/20). Discussions and Office Hours will start next week. More details on this will be added in the next couple days. Course Textbook Each lecture will will be accompanied by readings from the textbook Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani, which will be linked on the website. Accommodations The University of California - Berkeley provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities through the Disabled Students’ Program (https://dsp.berkeley.edu). For more information regarding these services, please contact the staff in the Disabled Students’ Program via telephone at 510.642.0518, visit in person at 260 Cesar Chavez Student Center, or email at dsp@berkeley.edu. If you are registered with the Disabled Students Program and are entitled to any accommodations, please contact staff at your earliest convenience. In compliance with Education code, Section 92640(a), it is the official policy of the University of California at Berkeley to permit any student to undergo a test or examination, without penalty, at a time when that activity would not violate the student's religious creed, unless administering the examination at an alternative time would impose an undue hardship which could not reasonably have been avoided. Requests to accommodate a student's religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times shall be submitted directly to the faculty member responsible for administering the examination. Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved. (See https://sa.berkeley.edu/uga/religion for detailed information). Please contact staff at your earliest convenience if you believe EDC 92640(a) may apply to you. We are excited to see and meet you all throughout the course – looking forward to a fun and educational semester!"

To ensure that we can continue answering as many questions as possible in a timely manner, please observe the following new rules about posting on EdStem. Please do not make private posts about homework questions asking us to debug your solution or determine whether or not your algorithm is correct, as the overhead on staff is incredibly high when many people do this. Instead, ask your homework questions in the relevant HW threads. If you have questions specific to your solution that you would like to double check, please visit one of our office hours for help. Starting HW3 (this Tuesday onwards), we will no longer answer debugging questions for coding question on Ed, with the exception of setup issues.

Make the request if you think you should've got more points and we'll take a look at it. Followups that ask questions that this post already answers, excessive +1's or ask questions that should be directed to regrades (i.e. questions containing ""should I make a regrade request about ..."") will be deleted to reduce clutter so that staff can find questions that require responses with more ease (a common response on the mid-semester survey is that there are too many followups that can be avoided by reading posts more carefully). That being said, feel free to ask questions or make jokes. FAQ (will keep updating this section): - Make a private post if you have an issue with your exam (eg, missing exam). Do not make a followup about this. - Details about the curve/passing cutoffs will not be finalized until after the final exam. Using individual assignment distributions along with Berkeleytime distributions can help you estimate your grade. Good job everyone - the material gets even cooler from this point on and we're excited for you to learn more about it! Please don't be demotivated by low raw scores as the class is curved."
766,"HW 11 Deadline Extended till Wednesday. Hi all, Due to the abnormally high number of non-content related issues that students are experiencing with this homework, we've decided to extend the deadline to Wednesday, April 19 10:00pm (with grace period till 11:59pm). Hopefully this gives sufficient time to iron out any issues."
785,"Midterm 2 Cover Page Remedy. Hi all, To remedy the typo on Midterm 2's cover page, we have settled on the following scheme for computing final grades. How final grades are normally computed: For each student, we first compute their final raw score by summing the scores of individual assignments/exams weighed by the weighting in the syllabus. Next we assign grades based on the final raw score following departmental guidelines and historical CS170 curves and performance. How final grades are computed this semester: We will compute two separate curves. Curve 1 is the standard curve described above. Curve 2 is computed with the following weighting: Homework: 15 MT1: 25 MT2:17 Final: 43 Your grade will then be the best grade out of both curves. These two curves are established independently from one another; therefore, no one's final grade will be penalized by the existence of the second curve. Your grade can only improve under this scheme."
804,"Homework 12 Update: Removed Q5. Hi all, Happy Friday! Due to y'all not having covered randomized algorithms in any form, we have removed Question 5 (Polynomial Identity Testing) from the homework. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, though on the bright side there's only 4 questions on HW12 now :) ~ CS 170 Course Staff."
856,"TA Small Group Chatting Sessions + General Advice/Answers of FAQs. TA Small Group Chatting Sessions Hello! Now that the semester is nearly over we are running TA small group sessions, where you could talk about anything with a TA - exam prep advice, study strategy, stuff related or unrelated to CS 170, school (undergrad or grad school), or just life in general. Here are the availabilities of the TAs and their respective topics they're down to chat about in the sessions. Grad students' names are in grey boxes. Feel free to go to any TA's session and feel free to go to as many sessions as you want. Note that this is not office hours but more like ""small group advising sessions""; we avoid the word advising because the TAs - especially the undergrads - are roughly the same age as you so we don't know how good of an advisor we could be, and we're also down to chat on anything. If you would like to drop by any small group sessions, please indicate it on this anonymous form so that the headcount of each session could be reflected on this spreadsheet for other students to see (CTRL-F TA + date to see how many people intend to drop by that session). See you there! General Advice/Answers of FAQs Below are compiled answers from course staff of frequently asked questions in the mid-semester survey and previous semesters' TA chatting sessions. Problem solving strategies / test taking strategies: How do I get better at thinking about creative solutions to problems? / How to become a better critical thinker when it comes to design algorithms and evaluate problems efficiently / For course staff, when you took the class, how did you come up with solutions so quickly? / etc. etc. James: As someone who came into this course knowing nothing about algos outside of 61b, I really struggled with problem solving. Heck, the second homework in the class brought me to the verge of tears. That said, the best advice I can give is to let yourself see and and most importantly understand as many problems as possible. Whether it be homeworks, discussions, past exams, or leetcode, being able to see what problems exist and how they fit into the algorithmic paradigms taught in the class are key to fitting your mental model. Once you've seen enough problems, even if you see a new problem, its usually a small tweak on one you've already seen, and with time you'll learn common tweaks to problems as well. tl;dr It's ultimately all practice. Viraj: It's all practice. As James was saying, ultimately most 'creative' ideas that you'll think of on the exam will be modifications of problems you've seen before (e.g. ""Oh this is like the reduction from Set Cover to ILP but...""). To best inform you, you should try as many problems as possible. What I do is that I try to maximize the amount of learning I can do - I find a problem (in DPV or past paper or wherever), spend 10-15 mins making sure I understand the problem and see if I can think of something similar to this/work on a sol. If I understand the problem fully but I'm drawing a blank after 15 mins, I generally try to peek at the answer, get inspired, then try again Chris: My approach to problem solving in 170 has mostly revolved around relaxing ""arbitrary"" restrictions that you place on yourself when approaching problems; maybe you've only seen graphs used as literal representations of physical things (roads + cities, social network w/ friend connections, etc.), until you realize that you can ""clone the graph"" to bake in more information into each node, and then you could realize that cloning the graph is really shorthand for graphs representing movements between ""states""--and many graph problems can be boiled down to defining a ""state"" (ex: location and number of greatest roads taken, location and progress on your to-do list, location and total bus fare, location of you and location of your friend, etc.) and defining the ""rules of the game"" (ex: move locations as normal but only update number of greatest roads taken when you actually go over a greatest road, or completing a to-do task is instantaneous so you can go from (location x, to-do task #3) to (location x, to-do task #4) with zero cost if you can complete task #3 at x, etc.). This is obviously way easier said than done, but I think the best way to draw conclusions like this is to look at many problems with the same topic at once; discussion + hw is a great place to review and see if you can draw common threads from between the problems, and then from there you can seek out additional exam problems with the same topic. These takeaways can start small and may seem too specific to be useful in most situations (ex: with reductions, when solving an easier problem via a ""harder"" problem, it's worth trying to trivialize as many unecessary aspects as possible), but as you see more problems you'll keep challenging your mental framework for these kinds of problems--until you've reached a place that is flexible enough to at least give you a foot in the door for most problems! you're on your own though for reductions though LOL of course, many of you already do lots of problems--in that case, if you need help generalizing your approach to a certain ""family"" of problems, feel free to ask us for advice! something along the lines of ""hey, for these kinds of problems I normally look here, here, and here for some possibilities on how I can approach it--but this problem doesn't seem to work with any of these ideas, what can I take away from it such that I'm more prepared to take on future problems?"". hopefully hearing some of our perspectives will help you broaden your understanding of the topic!tldr look at many problems of the same type at once and try to generalize your understanding over time to give yourself an in for the widening range of problems you've seen so far Exam prep strategies: Advice for final / How do you build a proper study plan for a CS170 exam? / etc. etc. James: I have a very particular exam studying strategy that I use for every single class, and its very time intensive, so take this with a grain of salt: Start by building your cheatsheet. I do this by going through the written material associated with each lecture sequentially and taking quicknotes as the cheatsheet. Go through discussions (and sometimes homeworks) in parallel with the current lecture you're going through so you connect the type of problems you may see to the theory itself. Do past exams, as many as possible. In 170 I quite literally did every past exam possible. You obviously don't need to do anywhere near this much to score quite well on exams, but volume helps (see my problem solving advice). Viraj: For me the order was a bit different, but same spirit: 1. Discussions + tricky hw problems, past papers, write cheat sheet a few days before, noting the tricky/notable problems down, continue doing papers and noting down the stuff you get hung up on Chris: okay if we're doing study plan reveal then I usually go through the same cycle for all my classes—this can be adapted to take anywhere from a couple days to 3 hours depending on your scheduling needs! briefly go over the lecture schedule to see what topics you remember being shaky on or straight up missed lmaoo (and, if this ends up applying to most concepts, just don't think about it too hard and keep going) for each lecture topic that applies to the previous step, read (skim) notes if you missed the lecture and review discussion + hw problems to try to draw common threads between them (see problem solving)--if you find yourself being stuck somewhere for a couple minutes, take a look at the solution to see what you were missing! we're going for more data on a tight schedule, so we need to act somewhat fast depending on the time you have available, either a. repeat this process with exam problems of the same topic (I'm a huge fan of splitting up exam problems by topic, if you need practice for the test-taking experience, leave the most recent few exams for last!), b. write some of the strategies you've managed to come up with on a cheatsheet (as well as other formulas + runtimes that nice to have but not super economical to memorize), or c. cut your losses, hope they don't do something crazy with this topic on the exam, and move on to another topic (if you have time), take a practice exam or two and wonder why last semester's exam always ends up being easier than the exam you have to take in all seriousness, i think bunching up problems by topic is a great way to find problem-solving strategies, fast. the mixed-bag nature of past exams is great for giving you an authentic test-taking experience, but I find that seeing many of the same kind of problem in one sitting is great for helping you build a more general understanding of a topic. maybe save a couple exams for the test-taking experience and then comb through the rest for relevant problems! General 170 material studying strategies: How to better pace myself in this class so I am not always falling behind? / Study strategies? / Best exam prep practices & class scheduling / etc. etc. Tianchen: I've been a student since 6 years old and so far I've never, ever laid eyes on a textbook better than DPV. The run from Network Flow to Duality to Zero Sum Games is like those seamless three-track-runs on an amazing album. If you haven't read DPV already plzzzz read DPV James: A few ways I kept up with the class: Lecture. I never, ever, go to live lecture for my classes, but 170 was the one exception because it is one of the few EECS courses with consistently good lectures. I took notes during these mainly to help me pay attention, but occasionally I referenced later. Read DPV. I always read the relevant DPV chapter after lecture to reinforce the conceptual content in my mind, which allowed me to come into problem solving with a solid theoretical foundation. Go to office hours. Seriously. Yes, 170 problems are usually doable if you think about them long enough, but I always tried to get homeworks done before the weekend so that I could postprocess that week's content and move onto the next week without worrying about another homework over my head. OH allowed me to always get homeworks done cause its much easier to figure out things with TAs and study buddies. Viraj: +1 on the OH - OH is a great place to get answers to your questions in a pedagogically valuable way. Typically what I would do is spend a few hours thinking about the problems, trying to come up with approaches / draft solutions. Then I'd go to OH with my friends and clear up my concerns, getting new ideas, then work on the problems. This was really instrumental in me 1. staying on track 2. still getting a good grasp/feel of the material (edited) Chris: YESS come to OH, and also speaking from experience office hours is literally free 1 on 1 tutoring the first two or three days after the hw is assigned deadass i shit you not its so economical and then hw party 1 or 2 days before the deadline will have the 30min waits that you always hear about on ed :( (edited) Research & Career opportunities: Research and career options from materials learned from 170? / What can I join as an undergrad who wants to pursue algorithmic design? Thoughts on 270? how is this field as a career path? / etc. etc. Zoë: Personally I'm most familiar with continuing along the academia path, but I know there are also options to be a part of research labs in industry where you can work on algorithms and other aspects of theory.I definitely encourage taking additional theory courses if 170 piqued your interest. If you enjoyed the algorithm design aspect, consider taking the advanced algorithms course; if you were intrigued by the discussion of P, NP, and reductions consider taking the complexity theory course; if you were excited the randomized algorithms, consider taking the randomness and computation course... There's so many topics we touched on this semester that are whole subfields of TCS! You might also take a look at the programs happening at the Simons Institute on campus, especially the week-long bootcamps, to see if there are any on a topic you're interested in (though you may get more out of it after getting more exposure to theory through these additional courses): https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage. You can also find recordings of past bootcamps to watch. If you're interested in potentially doing theory research in undergrad, there are two main approaches to consider that I know of: (1) taking one of the above graduate courses, which potentially involves a research-based final project, and then asking the professor who taught the course if they know of any opportunities to continue doing research in the area, or (2) looking for summer research programs, potentially through NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. They keep a database of opportunities: https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp. One REU that I know of that is particularly CS theory-focused is called DIMACS: https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu. Another way to find a summer research opportunity that can be hit-or-miss but that I personally had success with is to cold email a few professors, explaining your interest in the general subject/their specific research, attaching a resume, and asking if they have or know of any summer research opportunities—they might not have anything themselves but know who you should get in contact with (so while you want to demonstrate that you understand what their specific research area is, don't be too fine-grained about exactly what you want to do research on). If you don't hear back one year, don't be discouraged from trying again the next year once you have more on your resume. (Advice on picking professors to cold email: don't just email professors who are ""famous."" Maybe see who's in the CS theory group at a university close to your hometown and mention that you grew up there and are looking for an opportunity close to home, as professors may value giving back to their local community and a personal connection can be helpful (maybe you went to the same HS as their kids!). If you have any connections to grad students or faculty at a certain university, even if in a different department, ask around about who's known to be ""friendly"" to undergrads within the CS theory group. Be open to considering research areas that aren't exactly what you had in mind, as long as you still find the topic exciting!) Good external resources to study for CS170 (like Youtube videos, other websites) James: Reducible videos on youtube are pretty nice. Also if you want visualizations for things like DP or LPs, theres a million little javascript sites you can find by looking up things like ""edit distance DP visualization."" Chris: i love william fiset their videos are clean have great graphics and their graph theory playlist is so nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgXR2OWQnLc&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P What have you used CS 170 for later on after you took the class? James: Literally everything. I use concepts from this class every single day, and its changed the way that I think about every topic in computer science from hardware to ML. Wilson: In my experience, DP-like algorithms come up pretty often. In many problems, you realize that certain values are computed and accessed multiple times, so you should just cache the result instead of recomputing each time. These aren’t always framed as DP problems, but the idea of storing subproblems/values which are repeatedly accessed is pretty useful. I also took CS172 (computability and complexity), CS176 (comp bio), and CS270 (grad algo’s), so general algorithms knowledge and CS theory knowledge from CS170 carried over pretty nicely. Viraj: The medium and some hard Leetcode DP problems melt like butter with good DP understanding Leetcode / interviews: Any creative ways you've found to incorporate concepts learned in 170 into leetcode practice? (i.e. doing questions based on the content of that week) / For interview questions, what topics and applications are important? / etc. etc. James: The most common questions that you will see in interviews are 1000% the graph algorithms from the start of the course, mainly DFS and BFS. There's so many problem variations on these two questions and they easily make up 80% of interview questions that I've ever gotten. Another 19% are stuff that deals with strings or arrays. The last 1% is DP. People will tell you that DP comes up often, but honestly I've only ever gotten a DP question once and that was as an extension to a prior question that was solved with a graph algorithm. However DP still shows up a lot in leetcode questions so its still good to be comfortable with it anyways. Wilson: DP, DP, DP. Q: How much should you practice DP? A: Yes. All interview DP questions are just Leetcode questions and variations thereof. There’s only so many ways you can break down some array, matrix, or strings into smaller subproblems, so once you are experienced in DP, they just become free points. Otherwise, understanding asymptotics, specifically analyzing runtime and space complexity is important for interviews since interviewers often ask you to analyze the efficiency of your solution. How to be involved in 170 in the future? / How to become course staff? James: Start by applying for reader! Show passion in your application and explain why you love teaching/course content. Chris: your first position will be, by far, the hardest to get—so cast a wide net early on! apply to many classes that you could see yourself being on course staff for; you'll be able to leverage your experience afterwards and narrow in on your favorites What are the solutions for homework problems? Tianchen: all hw solutions are hidden in a secret ciphertext in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOBTswmt8g&list=LL&index=2 James: If you can prove P=NP then you can reduce all homework problems to the P problem of your choosing and solve it that way. Wilson: The solutions are the friends we made along the way."
