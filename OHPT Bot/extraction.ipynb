Then, in1979, ayoung Soviet mathematician called Leonid Khac hiyan came upwith theellipsoid algorithm ,onethat isvery different from simplex, extremely simple inits conception (but sophisticated initsproof) and yetonethat solves any linear program in polynomial time.Instead ofchasing thesolution from onecorner ofthepolyhedron to thenext, Khac hiyan' salgorithm con\\x02nes ittosmaller andsmaller ellipsoids (skewed high- dimensional balls).

      "[\"248 Algorithms The story ofSissa and Moore According tothelegend, thegame ofchess wasinvented bytheBrahmin Sissa toamuse and teachhisking.Asked bythegrateful monarc hwhat hewanted inreturn, thewise man requested that theking place onegrain ofriceinthe\\x02rst square ofthechessboard, twointhesecond, four inthethird, andsoon,doubling theamount ofriceuptothe64th square .The king agreed onthespot, and asaresult hewasthe\\x02rst person tolearn the valuable\\x97-albeit humbling\\x97lesson ofexponential growth .Sissa' srequest amounted to264 1=18;446;744;073;709;551;615grains ofrice,enough ricetopaveallofIndia several times over! Allover nature ,from colonies ofbacteria tocells inafetus ,weseesystems that grow exponentially\\x97for awhile .In1798, theBritish philosopher T.Robert Malthus published an essayinwhic hhepredicted that theexponential growth (hecalled it\\x93geometric growth\\x94) ofthehuman population would soon deplete linearly growing resources ,anargument that in\\x03uenced Charles Darwin deeply .Malthus knew thefundamental factthat anexponential sooner orlater takes over anypolynomial. In1965, computer chippioneer Gordon E.Moore noticed that transistor density inchips haddoubled every year intheearly 1960s ,andhepredicted that thistrend would continue . This prediction, moderated toadoubling every 18months andextended tocomputer speed, isknown asMoore' slaw.Ithasheld remarkably well for40years .And these arethetwo root causes oftheexplosion ofinformation technology inthepast decades: Moore' slawand ef\\x02cient algorithms . Itwould appear that Moore' slawprovides adisincentive fordeveloping polynomial al- gorithms .After all,ifanalgorithm isexponential, why notwaititoutuntil Moore' slaw makes itfeasible? Butinreality theexact opposite happens: Moore' slawisahuge incen- tivefordeveloping ef\\x02cient algorithms ,because suchalgorithms areneeded inorder totake advantage oftheexponential increase incomputer speed. Here iswhy.If,forexample ,anO(2n)algorithm forBoolean satis\\x02ability (SAT)were given anhour torun, itwould havesolved instances with 25variables backin1975, 31vari- ables onthefaster computers available in1985, 38variables in1995, andabout 45variables with today'smachines .Quite abitofprogress\\x97except that eachextra variable requires a year andahalf'swait,while theappetite ofapplications (many ofwhic hare,ironically ,re- lated tocomputer design) grows muchfaster .Incontrast, thesize oftheinstances solved byanO(n)orO(nlogn)algorithm would bemultiplied byafactor ofabout 100eachdecade . Inthecase ofanO(n2)algorithm, theinstance size solvable ina\\x02xed time would bemul- tiplied byabout 10eachdecade .Even anO(n6)algorithm, polynomial yetunappetizing , would more than double thesizeoftheinstances solved eachdecade .When itcomes tothe growth ofthesize ofproblems wecanattac kwith analgorithm, wehaveareversal: expo- nential algorithms make polynomially slow progress ,while polynomial algorithms advance exponentially fast! ForMoore' slawtobere\\x03ected intheworld weneed ef\\x02cient algorithms . AsSissa and Malthus knew very well, exponential expansion cannot besustained in- de\\x02nitely inour\\x02nite world. Bacterial colonies runoutoffood; chips hittheatomic scale .

Inother words ,weareasking this question: Whencanagraph bedrawn without lifting thepencil from thepaper? The answer discovered byEuler issimple ,elegant, and intuitive: Ifand onlyif(a)the graph isconnected and (b)every vertex, with thepossible exception oftwovertices (the start and\\x02nal vertices ofthewalk), haseven degree (Exercise 3.26). This iswhy K¨onigsberg' spark wasimpossible totraverse: allfour vertices haveodddegree . Toputitinterms ofourpresent concerns ,letusde\\x02ne asearc hproblem called EULER PATH:Given agraph, \\x02ndapath that contains eachedge exactly once.Itfollows from Euler' s observation, andalittle more thinking ,that thissearc hproblem canbesolved inpolynomial time. Almost amillennium before Euler' sfateful summer inEast Prussia, aKashmiri poet named Rudrata had asked this question: Can onevisit allthesquares ofthechessboard, without repeating anysquare ,inonelong walkthat ends atthestarting square andateach step makes alegal knight move? This isagain agraph problem: thegraph now has64ver- tices,and twosquares arejoined byanedge ifaknight cangofrom onetotheother ina single move (that is,iftheir coordinates differ by2inonedimension andby1intheother).

Inmany graphs ,suchastheoneinFigure 8.3,thesmallest cutleavesjust asingleton vertex ononeside\\x97it consists ofalledges adjacent tothis vertex.

Balanced cuts arise inavariety ofimportant applications ,suchasclustering .Consider forexample theproblem ofsegmenting animage into itsconstituent components (say,an elephant standing inagrassy plain with aclear blue skyabove).

We would like to welcome you to Spring 2023 iteration of CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, taught by Professor Prasad Raghavendra and Professor John Wright. Syllabus Please read the course syllabus (website still WIP, refer to this post for any reference to dates, times and links) which has the majority of the course logistics. Lectures As indicated in this semester's course catalogue, the lecture will be held in Lewis 100 every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11:00am to 11:59am. Lectures will be asynchronously recorded. Examinations As of now, exams are scheduled as follows: Midterm 1: Monday, 2023 February 27, 19:00 - 21:00 (7pm-9pm) Midterm 2: Wednesday, 2023 April 5, 19:00 - 21:00 (7pm-9pm) Final: Tuesday, 2023 May 09, 19:00 - 22:00 (7pm-10pm) (Group 8) We are not planning on offering examinations at an alternate time under any circumstance. If you have a conflict, \"\"ask the other class for an alternate exam, or if they say no, choose which of the two classes to take this term and drop the other.\"\" We are not planning on offering examinations remotely. Exam-specific policy will be released closer to the exam dates. Cancellation of Project, and Grading Policy This semester, we have decided to remove the CS170 project that has decade-long history. Historically, project consists 5% of students' total grade. We are also discussing the possibility of adjusting the weight of homework. We will communicate with you about the grading breakdown policy as soon as we explored the full complexity of such an adjustment and made considerate decisions. Prerequisites As outlined in the course catalogue, we will not enforce course prerequisites for this semester. Should you find certain materials challenging potentially because of missed prerequisites, please consult resources from that class. Communication and Gradescope We will use Edstem (this platform) for questions and online discussion and Gradescope for assignment submission and examination release. You will see a bCourses site on your bCourses dashboard but it will not be used as a form of communication – instead, you can gain access to Edstem and bCourses by going to the bCourses site and clicking \"\"Ed Discussion\"\" or \"\"Gradescope\"\" on the left. However, if you are enrolled in CalCentral but not bCourses site (which you shouldn't), please contact staff. bCourses/Kaltura also may or may not be used to publish course recordings as in the past there were occasions that for course recordings to become available for upload on YouTube, they must be closed-captioned first for compliance (see NAD v. Harvard) and such process take time. Please contact staff if you are auditing or are attending this course but not enrolled through CalCentral (e.g. non-BISP exchange students). Emails If you find yourself uncomfortable making a private Ed post addressing your issue, for logistics and administrative questions only, you may also email cs170@, a private email that is only seen by the Head TAs and Professors. Homework 1 Homework 1 (our first homework, which is not HW0) will be released on next Tuesday on Jan 24, and will be due on the next Monday after it was released (Jan 30). Discussion and Office Hours No Discussion or Office Hour will take place this week (1/16-1/20). Discussions and Office Hours will start next week. More details on this will be added in the next couple days. Course Textbook Each lecture will will be accompanied by readings from the textbook Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U.

In compliance with Education code, Section 92640(a), it is the official policy of the University of California at Berkeley to permit any student to undergo a test or examination, without penalty, at a time when that activity would not violate the student's religious creed, unless administering the examination at an alternative time would impose an undue hardship which could not reasonably have been avoided. Requests to accommodate a student's religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times shall be submitted directly to the faculty member responsible for administering the examination. Reasonable common sense, judgment and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved. (See https://sa.berkeley.edu/uga/religion for detailed information). Please contact staff at your earliest convenience if you believe EDC 92640(a) may apply to you. We are excited to see and meet you all throughout the course – looking forward to a fun and educational semester!\"\n",

How final grades are computed this semester: We will compute two separate curves. Curve 1 is the standard curve described above. Curve 2 is computed with the following weighting: Homework: 15 MT1: 25 MT2:17 Final: 43 Your grade will then be the best grade out of both curves.

If you would like to drop by any small group sessions, please indicate it on this anonymous form so that the headcount of each session could be reflected on this spreadsheet for other students to see (CTRL-F TA + date to see how many people intend to drop by that session). See you there! General Advice/Answers of FAQs Below are compiled answers from course staff of frequently asked questions in the mid-semester survey and previous semesters' TA chatting sessions. Problem solving strategies / test taking strategies: How do I get better at thinking about creative solutions to problems? / How to become a better critical thinker when it comes to design algorithms and evaluate problems efficiently / For course staff, when you took the class, how did you come up with solutions so quickly? / etc. etc. James: As someone who came into this course knowing nothing about algos outside of 61b, I really struggled with problem solving. Heck, the second homework in the class brought me to the verge of tears. That said, the best advice I can give is to let yourself see and and most importantly understand as many problems as possible. Whether it be homeworks, discussions, past exams, or leetcode, being able to see what problems exist and how they fit into the algorithmic paradigms taught in the class are key to fitting your mental model. Once you've seen enough problems, even if you see a new problem, its usually a small tweak on one you've already seen, and with time you'll learn common tweaks to problems as well. tl;dr It's ultimately all practice. Viraj: It's all practice. As James was saying, ultimately most 'creative' ideas that you'll think of on the exam will be modifications of problems you've seen before (e.g. \"\"Oh this is like the reduction from Set Cover to ILP but...\"\"). To best inform you, you should try as many problems as possible. What I do is that I try to maximize the amount of learning I can do - I find a problem (in DPV or past paper or wherever), spend 10-15 mins making sure I understand the problem and see if I can think of something similar to this/work on a sol. If I understand the problem fully but I'm drawing a blank after 15 mins, I generally try to peek at the answer, get inspired, then try again Chris: My approach to problem solving in 170 has mostly revolved around relaxing \"\"arbitrary\"\" restrictions that you place on yourself when approaching problems; maybe you've only seen graphs used as literal representations of physical things (roads + cities, social network w/ friend connections, etc.), until you realize that you can \"\"clone the graph\"\" to bake in more information into each node, and then you could realize that cloning the graph is really shorthand for graphs representing movements between \"\"states\"\"--and many graph problems can be boiled down to defining a \"\"state\"\" (ex: location and number of greatest roads taken, location and progress on your to-do list, location and total bus fare, location of you and location of your friend, etc.) and defining the \"\"rules of the game\"\" (ex: move locations as normal but only update number of greatest roads taken when you actually go over a greatest road, or completing a to-do task is instantaneous so you can go from (location x, to-do task #3) to (location x, to-do task #4) with zero cost if you can complete task #3 at x, etc.). This is obviously way easier said than done, but I think the best way to draw conclusions like this is to look at many problems with the same topic at once; discussion + hw is a great place to review and see if you can draw common threads from between the problems, and then from there you can seek out additional exam problems with the same topic. These takeaways can start small and may seem too specific to be useful in most situations (ex: with reductions, when solving an easier problem via a \"\"harder\"\" problem, it's worth trying to trivialize as many unecessary aspects as possible), but as you see more problems you'll keep challenging your mental framework for these kinds of problems--until you've reached a place that is flexible enough to at least give you a foot in the door for most problems! you're on your own though for reductions though LOL of course, many of you already do lots of problems--in that case, if you need help generalizing your approach to a certain \"\"family\"\" of problems, feel free to ask us for advice! something along the lines of \"\"hey, for these kinds of problems I normally look here, here, and here for some possibilities on how I can approach it--but this problem doesn't seem to work with any of these ideas, what can I take away from it such that I'm more prepared to take on future problems?\"\". hopefully hearing some of our perspectives will help you broaden your understanding of the topic!tldr look at many problems of the same type at once and try to generalize your understanding over time to give yourself an in for the widening range of problems you've seen so far Exam prep strategies: Advice for final / How do you build a proper study plan for a CS170 exam? / etc. etc. James: I have a very particular exam studying strategy that I use for every single class, and its very time intensive, so take this with a grain of salt: Start by building your cheatsheet. I do this by going through the written material associated with each lecture sequentially and taking quicknotes as the cheatsheet. Go through discussions (and sometimes homeworks) in parallel with the current lecture you're going through so you connect the type of problems you may see to the theory itself. Do past exams, as many as possible. In 170 I quite literally did every past exam possible. You obviously don't need to do anywhere near this much to score quite well on exams, but volume helps (see my problem solving advice). Viraj: For me the order was a bit different, but same spirit: 1. Discussions + tricky hw problems, past papers, write cheat sheet a few days before, noting the tricky/notable problems down, continue doing papers and noting down the stuff you get hung up on Chris: okay if we're doing study plan reveal then I usually go through the same cycle for all my classes—this can be adapted to take anywhere from a couple days to 3 hours depending on your scheduling needs! briefly go over the lecture schedule to see what topics you remember being shaky on or straight up missed lmaoo (and, if this ends up applying to most concepts, just don't think about it too hard and keep going) for each lecture topic that applies to the previous step, read (skim) notes if you missed the lecture and review discussion + hw problems to try to draw common threads between them (see problem solving)--if you find yourself being stuck somewhere for a couple minutes, take a look at the solution to see what you were missing! we're going for more data on a tight schedule, so we need to act somewhat fast depending on the time you have available, either a. repeat this process with exam problems of the same topic (I'm a huge fan of splitting up exam problems by topic, if you need practice for the test-taking experience, leave the most recent few exams for last!), b. write some of the strategies you've managed to come up with on a cheatsheet (as well as other formulas + runtimes that nice to have but not super economical to memorize), or c. cut your losses, hope they don't do something crazy with this topic on the exam, and move on to another topic (if you have time), take a practice exam or two and wonder why last semester's exam always ends up being easier than the exam you have to take in all seriousness, i think bunching up problems by topic is a great way to find problem-solving strategies, fast. the mixed-bag nature of past exams is great for giving you an authentic test-taking experience, but I find that seeing many of the same kind of problem in one sitting is great for helping you build a more general understanding of a topic. maybe save a couple exams for the test-taking experience and then comb through the rest for relevant problems! General 170 material studying strategies: How to better pace myself in this class so I am not always falling behind? / Study strategies? / Best exam prep practices & class scheduling / etc. etc. Tianchen: I've been a student since 6 years old and so far I've never, ever laid eyes on a textbook better than DPV. The run from Network Flow to Duality to Zero Sum Games is like those seamless three-track-runs on an amazing album. If you haven't read DPV already plzzzz read DPV James: A few ways I kept up with the class: Lecture. I never, ever, go to live lecture for my classes, but 170 was the one exception because it is one of the few EECS courses with consistently good lectures. I took notes during these mainly to help me pay attention, but occasionally I referenced later. Read DPV. I always read the relevant DPV chapter after lecture to reinforce the conceptual content in my mind, which allowed me to come into problem solving with a solid theoretical foundation. Go to office hours. Seriously. Yes, 170 problems are usually doable if you think about them long enough, but I always tried to get homeworks done before the weekend so that I could postprocess that week's content and move onto the next week without worrying about another homework over my head. OH allowed me to always get homeworks done cause its much easier to figure out things with TAs and study buddies. Viraj: +1 on the OH - OH is a great place to get answers to your questions in a pedagogically valuable way. Typically what I would do is spend a few hours thinking about the problems, trying to come up with approaches / draft solutions. Then I'd go to OH with my friends and clear up my concerns, getting new ideas, then work on the problems. This was really instrumental in me 1. staying on track 2. still getting a good grasp/feel of the material (edited) Chris: YESS come to OH, and also speaking from experience office hours is literally free 1 on 1 tutoring the first two or three days after the hw is assigned deadass i shit you not its so economical and then hw party 1 or 2 days before the deadline will have the 30min waits that you always hear about on ed :( (edited) Research & Career opportunities: Research and career options from materials learned from 170? / What can I join as an undergrad who wants to pursue algorithmic design? Thoughts on 270? how is this field as a career path? / etc. etc. Zoë: Personally I'm most familiar with continuing along the academia path, but I know there are also options to be a part of research labs in industry where you can work on algorithms and other aspects of theory.I definitely encourage taking additional theory courses if 170 piqued your interest. If you enjoyed the algorithm design aspect, consider taking the advanced algorithms course; if you were intrigued by the discussion of P, NP, and reductions consider taking the complexity theory course; if you were excited the randomized algorithms, consider taking the randomness and computation course... There's so many topics we touched on this semester that are whole subfields of TCS! You might also take a look at the programs happening at the Simons Institute on campus, especially the week-long bootcamps, to see if there are any on a topic you're interested in (though you may get more out of it after getting more exposure to theory through these additional courses): https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage. You can also find recordings of past bootcamps to watch. If you're interested in potentially doing theory research in undergrad, there are two main approaches to consider that I know of: (1) taking one of the above graduate courses, which potentially involves a research-based final project, and then asking the professor who taught the course if they know of any opportunities to continue doing research in the area, or (2) looking for summer research programs, potentially through NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. They keep a database of opportunities: https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp. One REU that I know of that is particularly CS theory-focused is called DIMACS: https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu. Another way to find a summer research opportunity that can be hit-or-miss but that I personally had success with is to cold email a few professors, explaining your interest in the general subject/their specific research, attaching a resume, and asking if they have or know of any summer research opportunities—they might not have anything themselves but know who you should get in contact with (so while you want to demonstrate that you understand what their specific research area is, don't be too fine-grained about exactly what you want to do research on). If you don't hear back one year, don't be discouraged from trying again the next year once you have more on your resume. (Advice on picking professors to cold email: don't just email professors who are \"\"famous.\"\" Maybe see who's in the CS theory group at a university close to your hometown and mention that you grew up there and are looking for an opportunity close to home, as professors may value giving back to their local community and a personal connection can be helpful (maybe you went to the same HS as their kids!). If you have any connections to grad students or faculty at a certain university, even if in a different department, ask around about who's known to be \"\"friendly\"\" to undergrads within the CS theory group. Be open to considering research areas that aren't exactly what you had in mind, as long as you still find the topic exciting!) Good external resources to study for CS170 (like Youtube videos, other websites) James: Reducible videos on youtube are pretty nice. Also if you want visualizations for things like DP or LPs, theres a million little javascript sites you can find by looking up things like \"\"edit distance DP visualization.\"\" Chris: i love william fiset their videos are clean have great graphics and their graph theory playlist is so nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgXR2OWQnLc&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P What have you used CS 170 for later on after you took the class? James: Literally everything. I use concepts from this class every single day, and its changed the way that I think about every topic in computer science from hardware to ML. Wilson: In my experience, DP-like algorithms come up pretty often. In many problems, you realize that certain values are computed and accessed multiple times, so you should just cache the result instead of recomputing each time. These aren’t always framed as DP problems, but the idea of storing subproblems/values which are repeatedly accessed is pretty useful. I also took CS172 (computability and complexity), CS176 (comp bio), and CS270 (grad algo’s), so general algorithms knowledge and CS theory knowledge from CS170 carried over pretty nicely. Viraj: The medium and some hard Leetcode DP problems melt like butter with good DP understanding Leetcode / interviews: Any creative ways you've found to incorporate concepts learned in 170 into leetcode practice? (i.e. doing questions based on the content of that week) / For interview questions, what topics and applications are important? / etc. etc. James: The most common questions that you will see in interviews are 1000% the graph algorithms from the start of the course, mainly DFS and BFS. There's so many problem variations on these two questions and they easily make up 80% of interview questions that I've ever gotten. Another 19% are stuff that deals with strings or arrays. The last 1% is DP. People will tell you that DP comes up often, but honestly I've only ever gotten a DP question once and that was as an extension to a prior question that was solved with a graph algorithm. However DP still shows up a lot in leetcode questions so its still good to be comfortable with it anyways. Wilson: DP, DP, DP. Q: How much should you practice DP? A: Yes. All interview DP questions are just Leetcode questions and variations thereof. There’s only so many ways you can break down some array, matrix, or strings into smaller subproblems, so once you are experienced in DP, they just become free points. Otherwise, understanding asymptotics, specifically analyzing runtime and space complexity is important for interviews since interviewers often ask you to analyze the efficiency of your solution. How to be involved in 170 in the future? / How to become course staff? James: Start by applying for reader! Show passion in your application and explain why you love teaching/course content. Chris: your first position will be, by far, the hardest to get—so cast a wide net early on! apply to many classes that you could see yourself being on course staff for; you'll be able to leverage your experience afterwards and narrow in on your favorites What are the solutions for homework problems? Tianchen: all hw solutions are hidden in a secret ciphertext in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXOBTswmt8g&list=LL&index=2 James: If you can prove P=NP then you can reduce all homework problems to the P problem of your choosing and solve it that way. Wilson: The solutions are the friends we made along the way.\"\n",
